#Hot Cold Game
**Authors: ** Ludmilla Rodrigues and Julia Guilhermino

## Instructions:
* How to compile the code: ./hot_cold.

## Rules:
* I’ll choose a random number in [1,30]. Your job is to guess that number.
* From the second guess onward, I’ll tell you if your guessis hot (closer than the previous guess) or cold (farther fromthe previous guess).
* If you wish to quit the game, just type in a negative number.
